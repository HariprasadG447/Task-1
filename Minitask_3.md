# Sun Tracking Solar Panel

The various pieces of the solar tracking system goes like this :

Circuit with LDR --> Microprocessor --> Servo motor --> Solar panel

Therefore, when the system doesn't work as intended, any possible bugs/errors in the system would be present in one of the above components.

## Troubleshooting

* Switch the circuits on and check if the solar panel is producing power. If not, then there is an issue with the solar panel.
* Check the working of the servo motors by giving them an always run code. See if the servo motor runs. If runs check if it heats up quickly or makes any high frequency and chattering sounds. If servo motor doesn't start then there is an issue with the microprocessor.
* Check whether the wiring has been done properly with the arduino and microprocessor.
